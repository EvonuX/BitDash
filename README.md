# BitDash
View &amp; Compare Cryptocurrencies

Built with React

Used cryptocompare API to generate coins and prices and react-highcharts for the charts, deployed to Netlify.
Also my first project using styled components :)

To build yourself you can download the code and run <code>npm run build</code> in the terminal.
